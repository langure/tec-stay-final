# Research Stay - Final Project
## Introduction

In natural language processing, accurately detecting and classifying emotions from textual data is a pivotal challenge, with far-reaching applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback interpretation, and human-computer interaction. This final project is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in this intricate domain of machine learning. The task involves the preparation, analysis, and emotion annotation of a text dataset, employing three distinct computational approaches: rule-based, neural networks, and deep learning.

## Objectives
The students will apply three different approaches to emotion detection: 

 - Rules-based processing. 
 - Neural Networks. 
 - Deep Learning.

The target deliverable is a written final report that includes the following characteristics:

 - Abstract
 - Motivation
 - Literature review
 - Experimentation
 - Results
 - Discussion
 - Conclusions
 - Bibliography

## Description

The students must download and execute the proportionated Python program capable of processing the prepared dataset. The program is adept at training models based on the specified approaches and generating emotion detection predictions. 

 - The rule-based method will involve predefined rules and lexicons to
   infer emotions from the text.
 - The neural network approach will utilize a more traditional machine
   learning algorithm, leveraging the power of artificial neural
   networks.
 - The deep learning approach will involve implementing more advanced
   and layered neural networks, allowing for a more intricate
   understanding of textual data.

The core objective of this project is to enable students to discern the nuances, strengths, and limitations inherent in each method. A comprehensive analysis of the performance differences among these algorithms will provide valuable insights into their respective efficiencies and applicability in various scenarios.

The deliverable for this project is a formal report with a critical analysis of the performance of each algorithm. This report should serve as a testament to the students' understanding and ability to critically evaluate machine learning techniques in the context of text emotion detection.
